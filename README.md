### Key Fixes Implemented:
1. **SEO Essentials:** Added descriptive meta tags, titles, and structured metadata in `public/index.html`.
2. **Accessibility:** Enhanced image `alt` attributes and added screen-reader support for dashboard controls.
3. **Asset Optimization:** Applied lazy loading on dynamic user profile assets to improve initial page load speed.
